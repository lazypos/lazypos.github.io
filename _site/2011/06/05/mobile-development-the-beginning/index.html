	<h1>Mobile Development: The Beginning</h1>
	<p class="meta">05 Jun 2011</p>
	<p>Well, it’s a Sunday and here I find myself writing a blog post. Well I did just promise that I wold keep up with this one, so I’m keen not to flop on the first hurdle.</p>

<p>In the last 18 months (or so) there has been a massive boom in mobile application or <em>apps</em> as they are know commonly known. My background is in web based applications, but there is a huge cross over to mobile applications and many high flying web apps also have sold mobile apps: facebook and twitter instantly come to mind.  </p>

<p>No surprise to us that are clients start asking if we can do mobile applications for them to complement or add to their current web presence. We always tried to push them back to the web (even mobile web) there was still a huge demand for mobile applications. We’ll I just couldn’t just ignore that huge demand; could I?</p>

<h2 id="mobile-applications-require-web-applications">Mobile Applications Require Web Applications</h2>
<p>OK, so not strictly true, but you do find that most mobile applications (even games) have some sort of <em>internet</em> connection to provide news articles, scoreboards, videos, photographs or what somebody is having for breakfast on there latest status update. So even mobile applications go back to the web.</p>

<p>RESTful services are so important to the success of a mobile application. The web based service that is taking requests and returning data (JSON most likely) is like the controller and the mobile device/phone is the view (yes that was an MVC analogy). </p>

<h2 id="the-beginning--the-web">The Beginning = The Web</h2>
<p>So although mobile apps are very <em>cool</em> and we all want a bit of that pie, we will never see web development disappear. Although I have loved working with iPhone’s and Android device’s, creating some awesome applications, I always have to remind myself that the beginning is still with web development. </p>

<p>I’ll hopefully be able to share more with you about my web development experiences, and the mobile world from iOS to Android. I promise that I’ll share more tutorials and screen-casts as soon as I get a chance to put something together. Basically I want to share as much as I can, and I hope it helps at least one person out there.</p>
